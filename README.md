  [The task](https://run.pavlovia.org/jingwang.physics/switchbeta/html)
  [The notebook](https://github.com/wangjing0/Switch_Analysis/blob/main/ExploratoryAnalysis.ipynb)
  
What I know: 
  * switch happens instanteuously 
  * do memorize the visit history
  * RT increased during exploration phase
  * RT increased was not due to slow down of hand move, but delayed initiation of the movement. the speed profile are almost unchanged.
  * 
What I am not sure about
  * is there a general strategy applied, or purely guessing? 
  * individual difference?
